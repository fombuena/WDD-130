  <h2> Pedro Herreros</h2>
  <p> 
    Hi everybody! My name is Pedro, I`m studying Software development. <br>
I`m 45 and married with Virginia, we have 4 beautiful children. I`m a member of the church since 2012. <br>
I`m so happy to be the opportunity to study in BYU, it is a great blessing for me and my family. <br>
I was born in Valencia (Spain) but I live in Durazno (Uruguay) <br>
<p>
  I can see the hand of the Lord in my life 
 every day, specially when I have to do things that 
are hard for me. <br>
I am grateful for my testimony about 
 Jesus Christ and to be member of the church
